# Customer Experience Analytics for Fintech Apps  
### End-to-End Review Intelligence Pipeline (Task 1 → Task 4)

This project builds a complete data pipeline for analyzing customer reviews from banking and fintech applications.  
It includes scraping, cleaning, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, thematic extraction, database integration, SQL-based insights, and visual analytics.

The work is structured according to the KAIM Week-2 task guidelines (Task 1, 2, 3, 4), each implemented carefully and incrementally.

==================================================================
TASK 1 — Git & Environment Setup
==================================================================

### ✔ Repository Setup
A new GitHub repository was created:

```
solar-challenge-week1 (then Customer-Experience-Analytics-for-Fintech-Apps)
```

### ✔ Branching Workflow
Branches created during Task 1:

```
main
setup-task
task-2
task-3
task-4
```

### ✔ Environment Setup
Created a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✔ GitHub Actions (CI)
A CI workflow was added:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

This workflow:
- Installs dependencies  
- Runs linting  
- Runs basic unit tests  
- Ensures project consistency  

### ✔ README + .gitignore
- Added `.gitignore` including data/, venv, checkpoints  
- Documented full setup instructions  

==================================================================
TASK 2 — Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & EDA
==================================================================

### ✔ Raw Data Acquisition
Reviews were scraped from Google Play for banks such as:

- Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)
- Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)
- Cooperative Bank of Oromia (Coop)

Stored in:

```
data/raw_reviews.csv
```

### ✔ Cleaning & Preprocessing
Script: `scripts/preprocess_reviews.py`

Includes:
- Removing HTML/emoji noise  
- Normalizing text  
- Lowercasing  
- Handling missing fields  
- Converting dates  
- Language detection  
- Filtering short/invalid reviews  

Output:

```
data/clean_reviews.csv
```

### ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial analyses included:
- Review distribution over time  
- Language distribution  
- Rating distribution  
- Bank-level trends  
- Frequent keywords  

Generated using:
```
notebooks/EDA.ipynb
```

==================================================================
TASK 3 — Sentiment Analysis, Themes & Database Integration
==================================================================

### ✔ Sentiment Analysis
Script: `scripts/sentiment_analysis.py`

Models used:
- English → DistilBERT sentiment model  
- Amharic → Translated or lexicon-based scoring  

Outputs columns:
```
sentiment (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE / NEUTRAL)
sentiment_score (0 → 1)
```

### ✔ Theme Extraction
Themes assigned using:
- Rule-based keyword grouping  
- NLP phrase extraction  

Themes include:
```
App Performance
Customer Support
Transaction Issues
Security
Fees & Charges
Other
```

### ✔ Final Analyzed File
```
data/analyzed_reviews_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

### ✔ PostgreSQL Database Creation
Script: `Database/database_setup.py`

Creates:
```
banks table
reviews table
```

### ✔ Data Loading Script
`Database/load_data.py` inserts:
- Bank names  
- Reviews  
- Sentiment scores  
- Themes  

### ✔ SQL Verification
`Database/verify_data.py` checks:
- Review counts  
- Sentiment ratios  
- Theme distributions  
- Ratings per bank  

==================================================================
TASK 4 — Insights, Drivers, Pain Points, Visualizations & Recommendations
==================================================================

### ✔ Drivers & Pain Points Extraction
Using the final theme parser + sentiment filtering:

**Drivers (Positive Themes)**  
Examples:
- "App Performance"
- "Customer Support"
- "Fees & Charges" (when praised)

**Pain Points (Negative Themes)**  
Examples:
- "Transaction Issues"
- "Login Problems"
- "Verification Issues"
- "Other" (generic dissatisfaction)

### ✔ Bank Comparison Example (CBE)
- High number of positive reviews (“easy”, “fast”, “helpful app”)
- Negative reviews primarily due to verification issues abroad
- Frequent theme: "Transaction Issues"

### ✔ Visualizations
Generated by:

```
scripts/analysis.py
notebooks/insights.ipynb
```

Includes:
- Sentiment distribution barplot  
- Rating histogram  
- Theme frequency barplot  
- Sentiment trend over time  
- Word cloud from themes  

Saved in:

```
visualizations/
```

### ✔ Example Insights Summary
CBE Insights:
- 85% positive sentiment
- Main driver: app responsiveness
- Main pain point: transaction errors + verification issues

BOA Insights:
- Strong UI satisfaction
- Pain point: slow performance

### ✔ Recommendations (Per Bank)
CBE:
- Improve remote login verification flow
- Enhance international accessibility
- Reduce transaction failure frequency

BOA:
- Optimize loading time
- Improve crash handling and stability

Coop:
- Strengthen UX consistency
- Provide clearer error messages

### ✔ Ethical Considerations
- Negative bias in user review behavior  
- Cultural/language variation in sentiment  
- Emotions, sarcasm, exaggeration  
- Potential misclassification of multilingual text
